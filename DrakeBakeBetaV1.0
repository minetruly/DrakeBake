Drake Bake Beta v1.0

The Drake Equation merely looks at things on a galactic scale. It's time to think big.

#How many alien civilizations in the entire universe have developed a technology that can communicate with anyone in the universe who is capable of detecting it? And what are the chances we'll pick it up?

#Change the variables to try different estimates.

#If the variable begins with the letter f, enter a number between 0 and 1, or 0 or 1.

#The goldilocks zone is the area where conditions are right for life. Stars must be close enough together for new stars to gain heavy metals from the deaths of other stars, but not so close that the radiation and gravitational disturbances from the other stars destabilizes life. You can set goldilocks values to 1 if you want to allow for life beyond life as we know it.
